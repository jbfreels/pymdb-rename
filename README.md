## requirements
* imdbpy

For convenience a *requirements.txt* has been added to ease import

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## string format
You can set your movie string format in *config.yml*.  I've tried my best to clone the same format FileBot utilizes for convenience.

* *{n}* - name
* *{y}* - year
